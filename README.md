# Market Dataset Analysis with EDA

In order to share my understanding of the concepts and techniques I know, I will take an example from the Market Sales dataset available on Kaggle and try to get as much insight as possible from the dataset using EDA. I got the Market Sales data set from the Omer Colakogluâ€™s data set that one of the leading SQL and database instructor in Turkey, shared publicly on Kaggle. I thank him for the data set.
